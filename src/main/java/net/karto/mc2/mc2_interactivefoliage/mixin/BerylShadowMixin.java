/**
 * Draws the GPU foliage into Beryl's shadow map, as {@code ShadowMapRendererMixin} does for Polytone's.
 * <p>
 * Beryl draws its shadow map in {@code renderShadowMap}: its terrain first, from its own chunk meshes, then the
 * entities through the game's own pipelines. The call that sets the light's projection for those entities is the one
 * place between the two, so the foliage goes in there, over the terrain it stands on.
 * <p>
 * Beryl is optional, and not on the compile classpath: the target is named, and does nothing when it is absent or
 * written another way.
