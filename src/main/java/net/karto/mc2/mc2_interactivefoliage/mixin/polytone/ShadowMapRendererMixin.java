/**
 * Draws the GPU foliage into Polytone's shadow map, which Polytone fills by drawing the chunk meshes again from the sun:
 * the chunk mesh leaves the foliage near the player out, so without this those plants cast no shadow. Drawn once the
 * terrain is in the shadow map and before the entities, whether Polytone drew the terrain itself or through Sodium, and
 * only when it draws the map at all.
 * <p>
 * Polytone is not compiled against: the class is named by its name, and only what every version with a shadow map
 * shares is read -- the sun's matrix, and from 1.21.11 its two targets. The method drawing the map has been renamed
 * between releases, so both names are listed. Applied only with Polytone installed, by {@link PolytoneMixinPlugin}; the
 * configuration is not required, so a Polytone release that changes these leaves its shadows without the foliage rather
 * than stopping the game.
