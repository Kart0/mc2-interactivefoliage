 * A push is Sway's, read from its engine, so it is seen the same whoever draws the plant, and for every entity that
 * pushes one. Only the start of a push shakes a plant -- standing in it does not keep shaking it -- and a plant
 * shaken a moment ago waits a second before it shakes again. The game's particle setting decides how many are shown.
