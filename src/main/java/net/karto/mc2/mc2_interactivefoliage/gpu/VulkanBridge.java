/**
 * What the mod needs from VulkanMod when VulkanMod owns the terrain, as {@link SodiumBridge} is for Sodium.
 * <p>
 * VulkanMod meshes and draws the chunks itself, with classes of its own that kept their names and shapes from 0.5 to
 * 0.6.8: a chunk build reads the level through its {@code RenderRegion}, and a finished build is put in place by
 * {@code TaskDispatcher.doSectionUpdate}. Both are reached by name, so the mod neither compiles against VulkanMod nor
 * needs it. It asks models for their geometry through its own implementation of Fabric's rendering API, which is how
 * the model wrapper keeps foliage out of its chunk meshes, and the vanilla call that asks for a section to be built
 * again is one it answers itself.
 * <p>
 * From 0.6.8 it stands in for the game's graphics device, so the renderer draws through it as it does through the
 * game's own, with three things to mind. Its shader converter takes no arrays in a uniform block and drops the
 * {@code out} of a function's parameter, so the foliage shaders use neither (see foliage.vsh and sway.glsl). It writes
 * a block's colours for any vertex consumer but its own with red and blue changed over, which the vertex writer
 * undoes. And it draws the chunks with shaders it reads from its own jar, which no resource pack replaces, so the
 * foliage is drawn with the mod's own shader rather than the terrain's.
