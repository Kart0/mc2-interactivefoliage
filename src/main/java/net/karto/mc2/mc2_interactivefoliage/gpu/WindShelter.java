/**
 * How much of rain's wind reaches the plants of one section, worked out while the section is meshed and baked into
 * its vertices, so the shader only multiplies by it.
 * <p>
 * Shelter adds up, from 0 for none to 1 for all of it, and the plant keeps what is left of the wind:
 * <ul>
 * <li>a roof: a block covering the plant, not far above it, takes half the wind. Deep inside, far from any opening,
 * the sky light at the plant -- which a torch never raises and night never lowers -- takes all of it;</li>
 * <li>a wall upwind: the wind blows west, as in sway.glsl, so each row of blocks is swept from east to west. A wall
 * takes half the wind from the plants behind it that are no taller than it is, as many blocks of open sky back as it
 * stands tall: the wind comes down over the top of it, so a taller plant still catches it. A wall that reaches the
 * ceiling on its downwind side seals the room behind it: the wind has no way down, so its shadow does not wear off
 * along a covered stretch, and it shelters a covered plant of any height. Covered means a roof over the block: sky
 * light alone cannot say, since it comes in sideways through doors and windows that let no wind in from upwind. A wall with a gap between its top and the
 * ceiling -- a window above a sill -- lets the wind in over it, as a wall in the open does.</li>
 * </ul>
 * A row is swept once, the first time a plant on it asks, and shared by every plant along it.
