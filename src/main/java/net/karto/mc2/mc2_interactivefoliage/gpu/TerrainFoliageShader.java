/**
 * Draws foliage with the terrain's own shaders -- vanilla's, or the ones a resource pack puts in their place -- so it is
 * lit and coloured exactly as the chunk mesh would draw it.
 * <p>
 * The fragment shader is the terrain's, used as it is. The vertex shader cannot be: it has to move each vertex first. The
 * mod builds it from the terrain's when the pipeline is compiled: every read of {@code Position} is pointed at a swayed
 * copy, the mod's inputs and {@code sway.glsl} go in next to {@code Position}'s declaration, and a new {@code main} sways
 * the vertex and then runs the shader's own. Whatever else the shader does to a vertex -- its light, its colour, its own
 * waving -- it keeps doing.
 * <p>
 * A terrain shader that cannot be read that way, or that does not compile once it is, leaves the renderer on its own
 * shaders, which draw foliage as vanilla does.
 * <p>
 * On 26.3 both shaders are read from resources as the game reads them -- the topmost pack's -- and handed to the
 * compiler with their includes written out, since the game compiles only what it reads itself. The mod holds the
 * pipeline, and closes it when the shaders reload. The terrain's section comes from its ChunkSection block, whose
 * shader variant the mod draws; the other, for multidraw, reads it from vertex inputs instead.
