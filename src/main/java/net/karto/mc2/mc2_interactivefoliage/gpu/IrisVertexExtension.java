/**
 * Keeps Iris from widening the mod's own meshing buffer, when Iris is installed.
 * <p>
 * While a shader pack is loaded and the level is being drawn, Iris rewrites every {@link
 * com.mojang.blaze3d.vertex.BufferBuilder} asked for {@code DefaultVertexFormat.BLOCK} into its own, wider
 * terrain format: it appends the tangents, mid-texture coordinates and block ids a shader pack expects.
 * That is right for anything drawn by a shader pack and wrong for the foliage renderer, which writes its
 * vertices for a pipeline of its own and reads them back at the block format's stride.
 * <p>
 * Iris leaves a way out for exactly this, a thread-local it checks before widening anything, so meshing is
 * wrapped in {@link #begin()} and {@link #end(boolean)}. It is reached by reflection so the mod neither
 * compiles against Iris nor needs it; without Iris, and if the field ever moves, both calls do nothing.
