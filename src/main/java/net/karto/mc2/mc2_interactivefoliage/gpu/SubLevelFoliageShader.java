 * are not the plot's own; see that file, and {@link SableBridge} for what a sub-level is.
 * <p>
 * No preprocessor line is left in what comes out: some of the shaders it goes into are parsed before any compiler
 * sees them, by a parser that takes none.
 * <p>
 * sway.glsl is every version's and is not written for it: the two things of its own that have to give way -- the
 * wind's direction, and the line that moves a vertex by its sway -- are changed in the copy handed over here, where
 * they are found worded as they are today. Where one is not, the wind keeps blowing the plot's west, or the sway
 * keeps to the plot's own axes, and the rest works the same.
