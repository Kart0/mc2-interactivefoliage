/**
 * Polytone's coloured lights ("Polylights"), from Polytone 6.8 on 26.1.2 and 6.9 on 26.2. Polytone rewrites the
 * game's and Sodium's chunk shaders as it loads them, so every read of the light map also adds the colour of the
 * lights around, and hands each program that reads its light volume the data it needs as the program is set on a
 * pass, whoever built it. The copy of Sodium's chunk shaders the renderer compiles itself never goes through that
 * loading, so it is handed to the same rewriting here; the data then reaches it as it reaches Sodium's own.
 * <p>
 * Polytone also writes the face a vertex looks along above its light level (bits 8 to 10) in every buffer built in
 * the game's block format, the renderer's mesh among them; the renderer's shaders keep the light level to its own
 * eight bits, and the Sodium copy hands the face on where Sodium's mesh carries it.
 * <p>
 * Reached by name: Polytone is never compiled against for this. Missing or changed, the foliage keeps the game's
 * light.
