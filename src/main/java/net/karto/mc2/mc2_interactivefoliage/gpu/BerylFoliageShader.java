/**
 * Builds the vertex shader the foliage is drawn with while Beryl's shaders are on, from the one Beryl draws its terrain
 * with, so a plant is lit, shadowed and fogged exactly as the chunk mesh around it: Beryl works all of that out in its
 * own shaders, from values the mod's shader holds none of.
 * <p>
 * Beryl's terrain shader reads VulkanMod's compressed vertices, a block id beside them, and where each section is from a
 * push constant and a block of its own. The copy reads the mod's vertices instead -- Beryl's source already carries the
 * declarations for plain ones -- takes the region's corner from the transform the mod writes for it, and sways the
 * position before anything is worked out from it. Everything the shader does from there on is left as it is, so it
 * hands Beryl's own fragment shader, which is used untouched, what the terrain's hands it. The shader Beryl draws the
 * terrain into its shadow map with is written the same way, and copied the same way.
 * <p>
 * Nothing here is Beryl's text: the copy is made as the game runs, from the file in Beryl's jar, and every change has
 * to find its place exactly once. Where one does not -- another Beryl -- there is no copy, and the foliage is drawn
 * with the mod's own shader, unlit by Beryl, as it is without this.
