// is. It is shorter the more the wind blows along the plants rather than across them, which bends them less.
// mc2_SubLevelHang: where a plant's tip hangs to, in blocks, as the plot sees it: toward the world's down, and behind
// the sub-level as it moves, followed through a spring by the mod so the foliage lags, swings past and settles.
