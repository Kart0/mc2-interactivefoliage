// Vanilla's core/block vertex shader as 26.3 writes it, with a sway added before projection: the modern
// counterpart of foliage.vsh, for the shading language that includes rather than imports and names a
// location for every input and output.
//
// The displacement is driven by the weights the mod computes per vertex from Sway's anchor for that
// plant: 0 where it is held and 1 at its free end. The sway itself lives in sway.glsl, shared with the
// other shader sets.
